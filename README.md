## About
In this project, a Genetic Algorithm is used to solve the TSP for small-sized real-life problems. It is therefore implemented in a Flask web application hosted with Pythonanyhwere.com. 
It can be accessed via https://vantablack9000.pythonanywhere.com. On the website you can upload a list of addresses or coordinates or manually set up your data base. The GA used in the code then works with dat retrieve from the open route service API.
This project has been part of a Master Thesis obtained at the University of St. Gallen. It was submitted to Prof. Dr. Ivo Blohm from the Institut f√ºr Wirtschaftsinformatik (IWI-HSG).
